### Installation Instructions ###

To develop your application via Eclipse, you need to install the following pieces of software.

- [Java Development Kit 7+ (JDK) (6 will not work!)](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
- [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/), the "Eclipse IDE for Java Developers" is usually sufficient.
- [Android SDK](http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing.html), you only need the SDK, not the ADT bundle, which includes Eclipse. Install all platforms via the SDK Manager!

Be sure to install these plugins. To do so, select the 'Help' option on the top bar, select 'Install New Software...", paste the links provided below into the "Work with:" field, and then click the "Add..." button.

- [Android Development Tools for Eclipse](http://developer.android.com/tools/sdk/eclipse-adt.html), aka ADT Plugin. Use this update site: [https://dl-ssl.google.com/android/eclipse/](https://dl-ssl.google.com/android/eclipse/)
- [Eclipse Integration Gradle](https://github.com/spring-projects/eclipse-integration-gradle/), use this update site: [http://dist.springsource.com/release/TOOLS/gradle](http://dist.springsource.com/release/TOOLS/gradle)

Once all of these tools are installed, proceed to [creating your project](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/Project-Setup-Gradle)
